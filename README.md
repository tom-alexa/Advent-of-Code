# Advent of Code

## Introduction
- Hi, I'm [Tom Alexa](https://github.com/tom-alexa). Here, I try to solve puzzles from the page [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## How to start
- First, open your terminal or command line.
- Go to the root folder of the project Advent of Code.
- Then, you need to paste your puzzle input into the right `input` file.
- You can do it by starting the script `puzzle_input.py`.
    ```
    python puzzle_input.py
    ```
- You will be asked for a year, a day and an editor.
- For the first time you have to answer those questions.
- Your answers will be saved and next time you can just press `ENTER` or you can rewrite your answers.

### Start a script
- Start the script `main.py` in the root folder.
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
- You will be asked for a year and a day.
- If you already answered those questions, and you agree with your answers, just press `ENTER`.

## Days
- Each day that has been solved you can see after starting the script `days.py`.
- Go to the root folder of the project Advent of Code.
    ```
    python days.py
    ```

# Advent of Code

## Introduction
- Hi, I'm [Tom Alexa](https://github.com/tom-alexa). Here, I try to solve puzzles from the page [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How to start
- Somehow you need to paste your puzzle input into the file `input`
- File has to be in the directory of the day you want solve

### One example how to do it from terminal or command line:
- First, open your terminal or command line
- Then, you need to go to the root folder of the project Advent of Code
- Paste your puzzle input into the file `input` with the right path
```
notepad {year}/{day}/input
```
### example :
```
notepad 2020/01/input
```

## Start a script
- Open your terminal or command line
- Then, you need to go to the root folder of the project Advent of Code
- Finally start script `main.py` with the right path
```
python {year}/{day}/main.py
```
### example :
```
python 2020/01/main.py
```

## Days
- Each day that has been solved you can see after starting the script `days.py`
- Go to the root folder of the project Advent of Code
```
python days.py
```
